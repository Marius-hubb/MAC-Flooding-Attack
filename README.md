 ### [Video Demonstration](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TvBOU8voSpZqPwOkw07pd52daGjEmmWu/view?usp=sharing)

<h2>Description</h2>
Macof is a network attack tool that floods a switch with Ethernet frames containing random MAC addresses, effectively overloading its MAC address table. It is part of the dsniff suite and is commonly used for MAC flooding attacks to force a switch into hub mode, allowing an attacker to capture network traffic.<br><br>

In this lab I will perform a MAC Flooding Attack using macof.
